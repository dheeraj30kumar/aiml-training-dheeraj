## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for learning the core concepts of AI and ML through hands-on projects. The programs are designed to give you experience with different types of machine learning techniques, from basic regression models to advanced neural networks and NLP tasks. 

The projects are part of an ongoing training program organized by **N.I.E.T College**, focused on equipping students with the skills needed to implement AI/ML solutions.

## Folder Contents

Here is an overview of the contents in this repository:

- **`Chatbot/`**: Code for building a **simple chatbot** using machine learning. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user inputs.
- **`House price prediction/`**: Implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, etc. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- **`Image Classification/`**: This folder contains code for classifying images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with libraries such as **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. It covers the fundamentals of image data processing and model training.
- **`Sentiment Analysis/`**: This project involves text classification using machine learning algorithms like **Logistic Regression** or **Naive Bayes** to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of given text data.
- **`Stock Price Prediction/`**: A machine learning program that predicts stock prices using **Time Series analysis**. It explores techniques like **ARIMA** and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for forecasting stock market trends.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
